# Hey, I am starting to write!

## What is this?
I decided to start this blog as a way to share my thoughts, ideas, or literally anything.
No censor, no judgement just my pure thinking. The topics might be pointless, useful, random, etc.
You might say it is like a personal diary or journal, but I would not consider it as one but rather as my own braindump everyone else who care might see (Judge me😅).
Also, I find this as a good way of taking a break from what I would usually do.
To do something a bit out of place — I do not write unless I have to.
Moreover, I also believe that writing improves articulation and communication skills.
From time to time I will be posting something new on to this site.

## Structure and Language
I primarily will use my own words. 
I will refrain from using LLMs to write every idea or convey what I want to say. 
Although I might use writing assistants which are particularly powered by LLMs to enchance my vocabulary and refine my drafts.
Rest assured that the use of AI and LLMs in my posts are minimal and are only used for writing refinement (unless there is an absolute reason why I have to).
I want to express my insights in a well articulated manner and I believe I can be more well-articulated person if I use those tools to improve the way I convey my notions.
It is the exact point of why I decided to start blogging in the first place.
Conversely, this forces me to read more.

That being said, you might see some typos, incosistencies, and slip-ups in my posts as I improve my writing capabilities.

English will be the primarily language here. 
Although, if necessary I might use Tagalog or Hiligaynon if absolutely necessary.
If I do, rest assured I will provide my own translation with the given context.
Non-English terms will appear in *italics*.
