# Hey, I am starting to write!
## Why?
I decided to start this blog as a way to unload my mind just a little bit.
The topics might be pointless, useful, random, etc.
I consider this as my own brain dump that anyone who cares might stumble upon (judge me).
I also believe that having our thoughts transformed into a form of something visible or tangible improves our articulation and communication skills.
From time to time, I will be posting something new on this blog.

## Language and AI Use
English will be the primary language here.
Although you might occasionally encounter Tagalog or [Hiligaynon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiligaynon_language) terminologies in my posts, rest assured I will provide my own translation with the given context.
Non-English terms will appear in *italics*.

I will refrain from using LLMs to write every idea down or convey what I want to say.
Although I might use writing assistants powered by LLMs to help me articulate some specific thoughts, I guarantee that the use of LLMs in my writing is negligible.
Relying fully on AI to expedite my writing process defeats the purpose stated above in the "Why" section.
Conversely, writing forces me to read more.

That said, you might see some grammatical errors, inconsistencies, and slip-ups in my posts.
Over the years, I’ve realized that people will always make mistakes in conversation—especially in casual ones.
Let’s do our best not to be pedantic about it—embrace mistakes. 
It is what makes us humans after all.
In formal or academic registers, of course it is a different story.

From time to time, I might update some posts to amend informational or grammatical errors.

## Subscribing
My blog is RSS-enabled. You can subscribe to it using your preferred RSS reader by adding `https://eillanrt.github.io/index.xml` to your subscription list.
Thanks btw! For starters, try using a service like [Feedly](https://feedly.com).

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is one of the oldest standards on the web.
You can use RSS readers to start subscribing to RSS feeds, such as this blog.

Even though this blog is not necessarily for virality and content creation in a traditional sense, having this blog RSS-enabled makes readers have a way to subscribe.

# Content
## Disclaimer and Discretion
***It is our responsibility to be cautious on what we read on the internet.***

I make **no** promises that I will:
- Always avoid vulgar language.
- Always provide strictly factual information.
- Refrain from writing posts that may contain literary spoilers.
- Please everyone.

I will add a Reader's Discretion at the top of a post if I find it necessary.

## License and Copyright

# Feedback and Suggestions
## Commenting
I am open to Feedback and Suggestions on anything that I post here.
I may or may not add a comment section for my posts in the future.
As of writing this, I am not planning on adding a comment section, as I do not consider it necessary.
This blog doesn’t have a feature that allows readers to give thumbs up or thumbs down on my posts as a way of showing appreciation or dislike.
This is by design. I am staying away from the engagement game as much as possible.
Also, it is the static nature of Static Site Generators, as the name suggests.
Though comment sections can be added, it would be an embedded plugin via a third-party.

Feel free to send me a message on my email though *(just not spam, ofc. Please)*.
Just note that I have a few rules in the online space of communication.

1. **Just Ask:** No need to ask for permission to ask—just ask your question.
2. **Message First:** Refrain from sending just "hello" or empty greetings; Always include your full message.
3. **Be Civil:** Let’s keep it civil and respectful.

That said, do not hesitate to send me a message if you have thoughts on any of my posts that you'd like to share. Or maybe you just want to invite me to a fruitful conversation.

That’s a wrap. I may regularly update this post to accommodate and address concerns to this blog.
This post is also available at the `/about` page of this blog for future reference.
